# Measurements
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

 - tBodyAcc-XYZ
 - tGravityAcc-XYZ
 - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyGyro-XYZ
 - tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyAccMag
 - tGravityAccMag
 - tBodyAccJerkMag
 - tBodyGyroMag
 - tBodyGyroJerkMag
 - fBodyAcc-XYZ
 - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - fBodyGyro-XYZ
 - fBodyAccMag
 - fBodyAccJerkMag
 - fBodyGyroMag
 - fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

 - mean(): Mean value
 - std(): Standard deviation
